This project generate colorfull geometric shapes from a context that specifies what shapes must be on the image. To achieve this result, I finetuned an already existing model (byrkbrk/conditional-ddpm) initially used to generate numbers from the MNIST dataset. \
For more details and results, please reade the "DDPM-for-geometric-shapes.pdf" file.
